PS: The downloadable .exe doesn't contain a Virus/Trojan or something which can cause damage to your computer (neither hardware nor software). The only Code which this programm uses is wathable in this repostry

PSS: the game doesn't make really sense and is very easy and it even still might conatain some bugs. It was developed for increase my programming skills in C++.

PSSS: I am only programming for 7 months now, so although the game isn't big, I'm really proud of it :D
